## BMFontGL

This is a free implementation of the bmfont font program from angelcode.com. This is an update of my googlecode.com code, with many fixes and updates. This is designed to be a simple "drop in and run" class, and can be modified any way you want with no licensing restrictions.


## Code Example

The code includes several examples of how to use the class, and shows scaling and rotation of 2d text.


## Motivation

This was a way for me to increase my knowledge of C++ programming, and hopefully it's a way to give back to the community.


## Installation

Download, compile and run! To add to your code, just drop the bmfont.h and bmfont.cpp into your gl code and use.


## License

This uses the absolutely free license from http://unlicense.org/, you can do anything you want with this code, although if you make it better, I'd appreciate you giving me the changes so I can make my code better for everyone.
